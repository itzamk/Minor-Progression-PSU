        The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. FERPA gives students rights with respect to their children’s education records. Schools must have written permission from the student in order to release any information from a student’s education record.

          
        <br/>
        <br/>

        FERPA allows schools to disclose these records to the following parties under the following conditions:


        <br/>
        <br/>
          <ul className="pl-6 list-disc">
              <li>School officials with legitimate educational interest</li>
              <li>Other schools to which the student is transferring</li>
              <li>Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes</li>
              <li>Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student</li>
              <li>Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school</li>
              <li>Accrediting organizations </li>
              <li>Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies </li>
              <li>State and local authorities within the justice system pursuant to specific state law.</li>
          </ul>
        <br/>
        <br/>
          
        Schools may disclose without consent directory information such as a student’s name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance.       
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        However, schools must tell the students about directory information and allow them time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification can be a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or email. This is left to the discretion of each school.
