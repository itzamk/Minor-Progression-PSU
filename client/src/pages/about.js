        This product is a Penn State minor and certificate tracker. Penn State offers a wide variety of minors and certificates. Many students have taken the correct courses to qualify for a minor but are unaware and never declare their minor in LionPath.

        This web-based application allows a student to upload their academic report and informs them what minors they qualify or are close to qualifying for. This will analyze a studentâ€™s academic history and compare them to a database of potential minors.
